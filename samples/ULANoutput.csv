He studied at Wichita University and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln where he received a BFA 1956. He also studied at Brooklyn Art School, and the University of Colorado. He was a prolific filmmaker, and was a pioneer in the use of ""found footage."" Most of his films are constructed from images shot by others and cut to new soundtracks, including popular or underground music. His film ""Crossroads"" was made entirely with official footage shot of a hydrogen bomb test in the Bikini Atoll set to a soundtrack by Terry Riley. Many of his films are considered precursors to what would become the music video genre. In the 1960s, Conner began making highly detailed ink drawings, referred to as the Mandala Series. In the 1970s and 1980s, concurrent with his filmmaking, he would create two-dimensional collages from 18th and 19th century etchings. He created large-scale photograms of human figures, and a series of black and white photographs documenting underground music in San Francisco during the late 1970s. His later work often incorporated obsessively created inkblots on paper, made with an accordion fold technique.","Bruce Conner|Conner, Bruce G.|Conner, Bruce Guldner|Feather, Emily|Bruce G.

Although he began as a figurative painter in the late 1950's along with artists such as Allan Kaprow and George Brecht, he turned to sculpture in order to explore the human figure as it relates to actual space and its surroundings. Segal's early work is often treated within the framework of Pop Art, because of the reference to the individual's position within mass culture and the examination of the relationship between fine and popular art. Later his work reflected social concerns. These works consist of plaster molds cast from living models in order to capture life like gestures, placed in environmental tableaux, which lock them in time. Although most of his figures remain white, in his later work he began painting them in vivid colors. ","George Segal|סיגל, ג׳ורג׳","artists|painters|sculptors"

"http://vocab.getty.edu/ulan/500010804","""Tinguely, Jean""","Swiss sculptor, 1925-1991","The Swiss sculptor began experimenting with motors in the late 1930s. In 1940 he began studying at the Allgemeine Gewerbeschule, Basel. After WWII he abandoned painting for sculpture. In 1953, with Daniel Spoerri he planned ‘Autothéâtre’ a performerless ballet of colored shapes and objects, which went unrealized. Soon after he began building his meta-mechanical devices, which could be set in motion by the viewer. In the late 1950s he produced the 'Meta-matic' painting and drawing machines; portable devices that allowed the viewer to produce abstract images on paper automatically. In 1960 Tinguely’s association with Arman, César, Raymond Hains, Yves Klein, the critic Pierre Restany, and others, led to the founding of the Nouveau Réalisme group. He created auto-destructive works including one at MoMA, ""Homage to New York' in 1960. In 1964 he began a creative and romantic relationship with Niki de Saint-Phalle, and in 1966 he collaborated with her and Per-Olof Ultvedt on a monumental sculpture, 'Hon.' He eventually married Saint Phalle, and they collaborated on a number of other works, including fountains and environments. He is considered a pioneer of kinetic art. The Museum Tinguely, dedicated to his work, is in Basel, Switzerland.","Jean Tinguely","assemblage artists|artists|sculptors"
